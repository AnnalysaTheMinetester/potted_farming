# Potted Farming

A new farming method for MineTest, not on soil, but on nice pots, even inside your house or castle!
I inteded this mod also to provide some nice plants to decorate your rooms.

## Things that you will need

#### Pot with dirt

The essential item, the whole point of the mod. You will need bricks and dirt, and some dye to make it somewhat stylish.

#### Watering Can

Some plants require your care, with you having to craft a watering can to give them water from time to time.
After all you are planting in a pot, not in the soil near water, so you are its only source of hydration.
It can hold very little water, afterall the plants do not require much, therefor it doesn't clear a whole water node.
Speaking of which, you can fill it also with homedecor items like the sink and well.

## Plants and Herbs

You can find these new plants in your world, and obtain a *stem* from them.
Planting it in a pot starts your journey as a pot farmer!
If there is enough light, it will grow and after a while you can harvest some leaves, without removing the whole plant!
If you don't harvest it, it will become thristy and you'll have to use the watering can. You will not loose the plant.

## Mushrooms

Are you tired of building a dark room to grow mushrooms and wait for them ages to grow only to harvest few of them?
Well ... you will build the same room, mushrooms require darkness, but at least you can harvest more than one
mushroom and they will regrow from the same pot!

## Fruit trees

Yeah you read that right. I present you a way to grow a potted little tree that can regrow fruits!
Plant a regular sapling and wait, it will eventually grow into a 2 node tall tree.
The leaves after some time will either grow 2 to 3 fruits that you can harvest, without hurting the tree, again no
need to replant over and over, or they will be tinted in yellow, meaning the tree is now thristy, in that case
you need to pour water into the pot.
